The first pass of this project/presentation ('capstone_report.ipynb') was centered around the idea of comparing attributes of the
mashable.com dataframe to its 'shares' attribute. The goal was to provide information on the patterns in the data and determine which
attributes were adding the most value and in what frequency (i.e. article length, number of images, number of videos.) The document
provided more of a technical presentation, focusing on providing examples of the code, graphs, and processes that one would use as a
data scientist.

The second pass ('capstone_report_reformat.ipynb') was created to appeal more to the layman, providing initial insights immediately
and backing up findings later in the presentation with the technical details. It was also suggested I include df.corr() immediately at the
start of the document to see where the data led me, and then also develop questions based on findings instead of just immediately comparing attributes to shares.

At first I found the second pass not to reveal much based on the correlation table. Working with the results, I examined correlations that were relatively high, and added some more statistics and visuals (t-test, heatmap). The questions and conclusions about the data are clearly displayed. A banner with the front page of Mashable.com was included as well.
